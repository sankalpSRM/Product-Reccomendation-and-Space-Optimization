# AI-Driven-Product-Recommendation-and-Space-Optimization-System-for-Small-Businesses
Small businesses often face challenges in identifying trending products that can be bought and resold for profit, leading to missed opportunities and inefficient inventory management. This project aims to develop an AI model that recommends high-demand products for resale while providing a curated list of reliable vendors for procurement. Additionally, the system incorporates warehouse space optimization strategies to help businesses efficiently store their inventory, maximizing storage capacity and improving overall operational efficiency. By addressing these key areas, the solution enhances profitability and supports small businesses in successfully navigating the competitive market.
